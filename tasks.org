* Tasks

** TODO [#A] Node to image

** TODO [#B] Java to image

** TODO [#B] Rust to image

** TODO [#B] Python to image

** TODO [#B] Nix based tasks

Need to dig a bit more in there

** TODO [#C] Ruby to image

* Tests
** TODO Create a e2e tests tooling

Maybe go, either here or extracted, maybe even in catlin ?
The idea is to make it easy to run tests locally as well as on the CI with the same commands.

** TODO Have a non-request buildkit-tekton/tkn-local set of tests

The idea is to run tasks for thoses and check which one fails

** TODO Try to also run tests those on CRC

* Misc

** TODO Generate tasks / layout from higher language
