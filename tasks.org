** DONE [#A] =go-ko-image=
CLOSED: [2022-10-28 Fri 13:48]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2022-10-28 Fri 13:48]
:END:

Or =ko-image= ? I am fuzzy with the name..

** TODO [#A] Node to image

This is actually tricky to do…
- Different commands to support =npm=, =yarn=, …
- Different "targets"
  + dist to nginx folder
  + container doing =nodejs …=
  + include the content into something else (see =tektoncd/dashboard=)

This might actually be the job for several tasks.

** TODO [#B] Java to image

** TODO [#B] Rust to image

** TODO [#B] Python to image

** TODO [#B] Nix based tasks

Need to dig a bit more in there

** TODO [#C] Ruby to image

* Tests
** TODO Create a e2e tests tooling

Maybe go, either here or extracted, maybe even in catlin ?
The idea is to make it easy to run tests locally as well as on the CI with the same commands.

** TODO Have a non-request buildkit-tekton/tkn-local set of tests

The idea is to run tasks for thoses and check which one fails

** TODO Try to also run tests those on CRC

* Misc

** TODO Generate tasks / layout from higher language

One idea is to be able to generate most of the content from a higher language. Not sure if
it make sense still, but
